#Gitlet Design Doc

## Classes and Data Structures

### ActionCalls
A place that stores the simply executables for our Main class.
##### Methods: 
init():

commit():



### Commit


###Branch - FILE

Here, the branch points to the very first commit object in the branch. Here, I will use different SHA numbers to 
represent commits, and the different branches will be the SHA ID of that commit that comes first in the branch. 

#### Instance Variables

msg: the message associated with the commit

parent: the parent commit. If no other commits have been created, parent is null

blobs: SHA-ID's of all the blobs in this commit

time: time at which the commit occured

ID: stores the SHA-ID of this commit

### Repository

No-Input Constructor Method: creates a new commit with msg('initial commit'), a single branch 'main', main will be the 
current branch. Time will be UNIX Epoch


## Algorithms


## Persistence



### Staging area
Staged for Deletion

Staged for Addition
